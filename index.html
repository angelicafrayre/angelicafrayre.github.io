        <h3 class="post-title">Top 5 reasons to buy handcrafted soap</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
         <p><strong>1. Handcrafted soap is made with natural, wholesome ingredients that cleanse without stripping skin of its natural oils.</strong> In contrast, commercially-made bars are made with chemical additives, or synthetic detergents.</p> </li>
         <p><strong>2. Handcrafted soap is real</strong> Since commercially-made bars are made with synthetic detergents, they cannot even legally use the term "soap." Instead, they may be called "beauty bars," "cleaning bars," "cream bars," or something similar.</p></li>
         <p><strong>3. Handcrafted soap contains glycerin to moisturize skin.</strong>Glycerin is a humectant; it attracts moisture and softens your skin. Glycerin is not merely added to handcrafted soap. Rather, it is naturally created in the process of mixing water, oils, and butters.</p>
         <p><strong>4.Handcrafted soap is an art.</strong>In addition to the science of executing the proper balance of ingredients, soapmakers take great pride in manipulating color, shape and fragrance to produce beautiful looking bars of soap that are fun to use and display. Believe me, I've seen handcrafted soap bars that look good enough to eat!</p>
         <p><strong>5.Handcrafted soap smells wonderful.</strong>Sometimes, handcrafted soaps may retain the rich scent of their natural oils. More often, handcrafted soaps have been made with essential oils that give of their healing properties and luscious scents. Many soapmakers also use fragrance oils, though, fragrance oils are considered a synthetic ingredient.</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">What are the benefits of handmade soap?</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p> Natural soap is made from a chemical reaction between water, lye (also known as sodium hydroxide), and fats and oils. These fats and oil are turned into soap and glycerine by a chemical process called ‘Saponification’. This process, when completed properly, leaves you with pure soap, glycerine, and some residue from the natural ingredients in the individual recipe.</p>
            <p> Handmade soap is almost always made in small batches. You won’t find huge “handmade soap” factories out there.</p>
